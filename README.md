# ðŸš— Driver Behaviour Classification

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

Driver Behaviour Classification aims to enhance road safety by identifying and categorizing various driving styles using neural networks. This project leverages Deep Neural Networks (DNN) and Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTM) to analyze preprocessed driving data, providing insights into driver behaviour that can be utilized for developing advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS).

## ðŸ“– Methodology

### Neural Network Architectures Used:

1. **Deep Neural Network (DNN):**

   - A feedforward neural network with multiple hidden layers designed to capture complex patterns in driving data.

2. **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM):**

   - A recurrent neural network (RNN) type adept at learning sequential data, making it suitable for time-series driving patterns.
